Life is a massive multiplayer role-playing game. You are a character in this game and so is everyone else, the universe our shared game world. We are all dealt a hand of cards, a form of character sheet, with a set of characteristics and a set of possibilities. How we choose to play our hand and what possibilities we pursue is up to us.

The best any of us can do is to play the hand we are dealt as best we can within the time period and environment we have access to.

The ultimate meaning of this game of life being the same as any other game, to play it in a fulfilling and enjoyable way. The ultimate honor being to make the game more fulfilling for every current and future player.
