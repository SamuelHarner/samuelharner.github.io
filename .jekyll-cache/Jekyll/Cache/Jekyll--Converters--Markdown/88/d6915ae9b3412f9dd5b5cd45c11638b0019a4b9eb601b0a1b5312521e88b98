I"8C<p>Modern life has brought with it a lot of comforts and quality of life enhancements, but mismatches between modern life and the evolution of the human body have also led to many health pitfalls. These pitfalls can be mental and physical, but in this post I will focus on principles for avoiding the pitfalls that can lead to physical decrepity.</p>

<p><strong>Disclaimer:</strong> None of this is medical advice, but rather a short introduction or reminder of important principles for physical health.</p>

<h1 id="sleep">Sleep</h1>
<p>In some areas of modern society, sleep has become viewed as a luxury which can be sacrificed to some degree, in order to provide time to accomplish more. What this view misses is that sleep is an essential and active process that maintains mental, physical, and cognitive health. Sacrificing sleep on a regular basis may therefore lead to less productivity and more health issues in the long term.</p>

<h2 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Get the recommended quantity of sleep, which for most people is 7-9 hours</li>
  <li>Try to get high quality sleep by following a healthy circadian rhythm</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="circadian-rhythm">Circadian rhythm</h1>
<p>Modern humans often act against their circadian rhythm when it comes to sleep, light exposure, and food intake.</p>

<h2 id="recommendations-1">Recommendations</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Follow a healthy circadian rhythm such as that proposed by Satchin Panda, Professor at Salk Institute for Biological Studies, in the following <a href="​​https://twitter.com/SatchinPanda/status/1345379570556481536">tweet</a></li>

<h1 id="movement">Movement</h1>
<p>In modern society, being sedentary has to a large extent become the norm. While past humans often were active by necessity, modern humans need to make deliberate decisions to be active, for example by choosing to walk or cycle instead of using motorized transport.</p>

<p>The healthiest and longest-lived populations identified around the world, the so-called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_zone">Blue Zones</a>, get a lot of natural movement every day from activities such as walking, gardening, or preparing food. Incorporating natural movement into one’s lifestyle is a good starting point for avoiding sedentarism, however for optimal longevity benefits intensity of movement is also important. David Sinclair, Professor of Genetics at Harvard Medical School, and his co-author Matthew LaPlante write on page 104 of their book <em>Lifespan</em>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“There is a difference between a leisurely walk and a brisk run, however. To engage our longevity genes fully, intensity does matter.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Valter Longo, Professor of Gerontology at University of Southern California, provides recommendations on exercise on his <a href="https://www.valterlongo.com/exercise-and-longevity/">website</a>, where he emphasizes daily walking as well as regular cardio and strength training.</p>

<h2 id="recommendations-2">Recommendations</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Get some movement everyday, whether it be exercise, walking, gardening or whatever else</li>
  <li>Try to stay active throughout the day</li>
  <li>For optimal benefits, do some high intensity exercise and both cardio and strength training</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="footwear">Footwear</h1>
<p>Modern shoes are often designed for fashion and/or comfort, and not for health.</p>

<h2 id="recommendations-3">Recommendations</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Go barefoot if appropriate or wear more minimal footwear, such as so-called barefoot shoes, that build better foot musculature.</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="posture">Posture</h1>
<p>Modern sedentary lifestyles and office working environments often lead to poor postural habits, which can result in back and neck issues and repetitive strain injury (RSI) among other things.</p>

<h2 id="recommendations-4">Recommendations</h2>
<ul>
  <li>If possible design your work setup around good posture and ergonomics (for office work this can mean favoring standing desks and ensuring screens are at eye level)</li>

<h1 id="breathing">Breathing</h1>
<p>Pollution, allergies, and poor jaw health has led to more people developing mouth breathing habits. Other bad breathing habits such as over-breathing have also become common.</p>

<h2 id="recommendations-5">Recommendations</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Adopt slow and rhythmic nasal breathing as your default breathing pattern</li>
  <li>Learn to nasal breath during exercise</li>
  <li>Consider taping your mouth during the night (for example with a micropore surgical tape) to prevent mouth breathing during sleep</li>

<h1 id="jaw-and-dental-health">Jaw and dental health</h1>
<p>Mouth breathing, bad posture,  soft and sugary modern food, and unnecessary removal of teeth and retractive orthodontics (such as braces) has led to an epidemic of jaw and dental issues around the world. Before the agricultural and industrial revolutions, which made soft processed foods more widespread, humans naturally had better jaw and dental health than modern humans do today, as can be seen by <a href="https://www.ucd.ie/news/2015/02FEB15/050215-Malocclusion-and-dental-crowding-arose-12000-years-ago-with-earliest-farmers-study-shows.html">comparing human skulls from populations that lived before and after the agricultural revolution</a>. Similar comparisons have also been done on generations of native populations before and after they adopt modern diets, and a similar trend is seen that after <a href="https://www.ericdavisdental.com/facial-orthotropics-for-your-child/why-raise-unhealthy-children/how-our-ancestors-formed-full-faces-and-straight-teeth/">adopting a modern diet jaws become narrower and teeth become crowded and crooked</a>.</p>

<h2 id="recommendations-6">Recommendations</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Eat unprocessed foods that facilitate more chewing</li>
  <li>When not using your mouth, assume a resting posture of; mouth closed, tongue against roof of mouth, and teeth close together or in light contact</li>
  <li>More can be learned about promoting healthy jaw development from the field of Orthotropics</li>

<h1 id="diet-and-fasting">Diet and fasting</h1>
<p>Many modern diets contain a lot of ultra-processed foods, that are high in saturated fat, salt, and sugar, and a lack of health-promoting nutrients. The long-lived populations in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_zone">Blue Zones</a> all have in common a diet that is high in plants and low in meat. Dietary recommendations made based on the study of genetic mechanisms for growth and repair, such as those from <a href="https://www.valterlongo.com/daily-longevity-diet-for-adults/">Valter Longo</a> and <a href="https://lifespanbook.com/4-interventions/">David Sinclair</a>, also echo the sentiment of a diet being high in whole-foods and plants being one that promotes health and longevity. Periods of fasting also provide additional benefits in terms of repair and rejuvenation.</p>

<h2 id="recommendations-7">Recommendations</h2>
<p>Eat a healthy diet, for example one that is:</p>
<ul>
  <li>high in unprocessed foods and health-promoting plants</li>
  <li>low in meat, dairy, saturated fat, and sugar</li>
  <li>not too high in salt</li>
</ul>

<p>In addition to time-restricted eating, as described in the section on Circadian rhythm, adopt a suitable fasting regimen that can be performed intermittently and safely, such as a <a href="https://www.valterlongo.com/fasting-mimicking-program-and-longevity/">5-day Fasting Mimicking Diet recommended by Valter Longo</a>. Water fasting for 1-5 days is also an option for most people, but carries a higher risk of adverse effects and requires more diligent preparation.</p>

<h1 id="microbiome">Microbiome</h1>
<p>Modern environments can sometimes be overly sterilized, which according to the hygiene hypothesis can lead to a lack of exposure to microorganisms, resulting in an increased risk of allergies and an impaired immune system. Overuse of antibiotics and excessive bodily washing can impair the human microbiome, by depleting the amount of good health-promoting bacteria in the gut and on the skin. Additionally, modern diets are often lacking in fiber and healthy bacteria that can contribute to a healthy gut microbiome.</p>

<h2 id="recommendations-8">Recommendations</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Eat foods that are good sources of prebiotics and probiotics, for example foods high in fiber and fermented foods</li>
  <li>Be wary of dental products that may damage your microbiome (such as triclosan in toothpaste and Chlorhexidine mouthwash)</li>
  <li>Wash hands with soap as recommended, but otherwise avoid excessive washing</li>
  <li>Spend time in unsterilized natural environments</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="pollution">Pollution</h1>
<p>Pollution can exist in many different forms (air pollution, water pollution, etc.) and have many negative health effects, such as increasing risk of cancer and respiratory diseases.</p>

<h2 id="recommendations-9">Recommendations</h2>

<p>Smoking can have many negative health effects, for smokers and those around smokers, for example in the form of impaired lung function, increased risk of cancer, and accelerated aging. David Sinclair and Matthew LaPlante write on pages 71-72 of their book <em>Lifespan</em>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“We know that smoking accelerates the aging clock and makes you more likely to die than a nonsmoker – 15 years earlier, on average.”</p>
</blockquote>
