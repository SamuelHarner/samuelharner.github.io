# Introduction
This is a short summary of the core concepts underlying computer science and programming, that are commonly taught as part of a bachelor's degree in computer science. The most basic concepts of control flow in programming (such as if-statements and for-loops) will not be covered specificly, nor will related tangential topics such as human-computer interaction or areas of mathematics used in computer science (such as linear algebara and discrete mathematics).
