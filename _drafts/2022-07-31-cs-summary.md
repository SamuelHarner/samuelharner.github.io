# Introduction
This is a short summary of the core concepts underlying computer science and programming, based on my 3-year bachelor's degree in computer science. The most basic concepts of control flow in programming (such as if-statements and for-loops) will not be covered specifically, nor will related tangential topics such as human-computer interaction or areas of mathematics used in computer science (such as linear algebara and discrete mathematics).

The following concepts will be covered:
- [Data structure](#data-structures)
- [Algorithms](#algorithms)
- [Complexity](#complexity)
- [Models of computation](#models-of-computation)
- [Programming paradigms](#programming-paradigms)
- [Computer architecture and components](#computer-architecture-and-components)
- [Operating systems](#operating-systems)
- [Software engineering](#software-engineering)


# Data structures
Data structures are different methods for connecting data into a collection of data. Depending on how the data is connected, the collection will vary in the properties of how data can be accessed or how the collection can be altered. For example, some data collections may allow a specific data element to be accessed directly, whereas other collections will require a searching process to find the requested element. 

Which data structure is most appropriate to use will vary based on the task. For certain tasks quick access of elements may be important, whereas for other tasks it may be more important to be able to quickly add elements to the collection. In general there is no data structure that performs the best on all imaginable properties of a structure. Therefore, there are often design choices and tradeoffs to be made when choosing a data structure. 

These are some of the most fundamental data structures:
- [Array](#array)
- [Stack](#stack)
- [Linked list](#linked-list)
- [Queue](#queue)
- [Hash table](#hash-table)
